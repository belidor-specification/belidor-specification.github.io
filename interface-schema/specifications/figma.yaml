- notes:
    - the grouping thing makes it a bit harder to do associate things together within a group
      - maybe when it's under 'affects' it's carving up a set, when it's directly under the (group) statement,
      elements in the same group get mapped together (ie. it's building up a set).
      - it's probably cleaner to have a different keyword for that eg. 'contains'. but it's a subtle difference.
      - maybe if you define the relation inside the group, it is matched per group elements?
